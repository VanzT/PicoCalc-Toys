Space bar = roll dice
Up/Down/Left/Right = navigate cursor/piece around the board
Enter = pick up or drop off a piece
t = end turn
b = bear off a piece

Notes:
- cursor is red when not holiding a piece
- cursor turns green when a piece has been picked up
- you may drop a piece back from where it was picked up without penalty
- if you start your turn with 1 or more pieces on the bar, the cursor turns green indicating
that you have picked up a piece from the bar.  Place it in a legal space to re-enter that piece
- if you cannot bar off a piece, you must press t to end your turn
- cursor blinks 3 times if you attempt an invalid move
- to bear off, move the cursor to the space where you want to bear off and press b.  Otherwise,
press enter as normal to pick it up and move it.  You cannot bear off a piece by pressing enter. Only b
