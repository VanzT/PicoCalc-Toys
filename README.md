alien.bas - weak attempt at the motion tracker display from Alien

bkgmn.bas - playable "pass the device" Backgammon game

bkgmn.txt - notes on Backgammon game mechanics

bsg1.bas - Battlestar Galactica original series.  Attempt at tactical radar display
Could be worse.

ghost.bas - shove a wire in GPIO28 and detect 'ghosts'!  Just a dumb program that 
reads from analog input 28 that isn't grounded.  Meaning, it is reading ambient 
electrical energy around the device.  Press 1 or 2 to switch between different
methods of recording the data.

matrix.bas - The Matrix style animation.  I'm quite pleased with the random white
flashes at the head of some drops

muthur.bas - very lame Alien-ish animation.  Terrible, is a kind description

nostromo.bas - farily proud of this one.  Another Alien inspired animation

rgb.bas - I put an 8 RGB LED strip inside my pico and this makes neat effect.
Totally stolen from https://steinlaus.de/rgb-led-stick-fuer-den-picocalc/ and 
they deserve all credit.
